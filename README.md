Shortcut Translator
===================

[Intellij Idea] plugin.
Translates shortcuts from one keymap to another.
Let's say you want to try this Jetbrains IDE you heard about, but you are used to the Eclipse / TextMate / Emacs / Netbeans shortcuts. Sure, you can easily change your keymap in IDEA / RubyMine / PyCharm ...
But you want to learn the default Intellij shortcuts, just like you learned the TextMate shortcuts in TextMate and the Eclipse shortcuts in Eclipse. This plugin together with the ctrl+shift+a
shortcut wil get you up to speed in no time.

It uses the built in keymaps in IntelliJ to do the translation.

Rate this plugin in the [Plugin Repository].

Usage
-----
Once installed, Ctrl+Shift+K brings up the dialog, any shortcut you press when the dialog is shown is translated from 
the selected source keymap to the selected target keymap. Press Esc, or click 'Ok' to close the dialog again.
